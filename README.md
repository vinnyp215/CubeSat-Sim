# CubeSat-Sim
 An attempt at simulating the workings of a CubeSat orbiting Earth.

 Progress so far:
 - Spacecraft trajectory integrated over time
 - Spacecraft attitude integrated over time
 - Spacecraft trajectory has been plotted
 - Spacecraft attitude has been plotted

 Wishlist:
 - Implement more complex orbital dynamics model (J2, solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag)
 - Implement attitude control systems
 - Create sub-systems:
  - Power
  - AOCS (Reaction Wheels, Magnetorquer)
  - Solar Panels (Requires calculating sun exposure)
- Create Ground Station

Underlying Theory:
